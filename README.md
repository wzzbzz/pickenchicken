# Picken Chicken Game

**Picken Chicken** is a casual sports betting game designed by Glenn Hillman, currently being implemented by Jim Williams Consulting.

## Objective

The primary objective of the game is to make optimal picks against an AI opponent. The AI's decision-making algorithm is based on random selections (i.e., `rnd()`), serving as a baseline to measure player performance against pure chance.

## Development Progress

This initial attempt used a custom MVC framework, implemented as a part of my ongoing struggle to comprehend Model / View / Controller aka MVC, which was a model I have always found severely lacking.
