# Picken Chicken Game

**Picken Chicken** is a casual sports betting game designed by Glenn Hillman, currently being implemented by Jim Williams Consulting.

## Objective

The primary objective of the game is to make optimal picks against an AI opponent. The AI's decision-making algorithm is based on random selections (i.e., `rnd()`), serving as a baseline to measure player performance against pure chance.

## Development Progress

This initial attempt is a Wordpress plugin which leverages the Wordpress MVC model I was trying to implement.
