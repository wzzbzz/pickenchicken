# Picken Chicken Game

**Picken Chicken** is a casual sports betting game designed by Glenn Hillman, currently being implemented by Jim Williams Consulting.

## Objective

The primary objective of the game is to make optimal picks against an AI opponent. The AI's decision-making algorithm is based on random selections (i.e., `rnd()`), serving as a baseline to measure player performance against pure chance.

## Development Progress

This initial attempt is a Wordpress plugin which leverages the Wordpress MVC model I was trying to implement.   

At this point in the development, I took employment with sports betting marketer American Affiliates to learn more about the industry, and more importantly the data. 

I have since started a new code base using Symfony, which I'll get linked in here.
