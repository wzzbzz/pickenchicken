# Picken Chicken Game

**Picken Chicken** is a casual sports betting game designed by Glenn Hillman, currently being implemented by Jim Williams Consulting.

## Objective

The primary objective of the game is to make optimal picks against an AI opponent. The AI's decision-making algorithm is based on random selections (i.e., `rnd()`), serving as a baseline to measure player performance against pure chance.

## Development Progress

This initial attempt was abandoned due to ongoing challenges with folder structures and the development of a custom framework, leading to indecision in design.

I have since resumed development using the Symfony framework. The project now follows a structured model including:
- **Entities**: Define the data structure.
- **Controllers**: Handle business logic and user interactions.
- **Repositories**: Manage database operations.
- **Commands**: Perform application-specific tasks.

The updated codebase will be made available for review.
